Code Structure

setup(): Initializes the LCD and button pins

loop(): Handles button input, redraws the menu, and checks for selection

draw_menu(): Displays the current two-item menu window on the LCD

handle_input(): Reads buttons and updates the current selection

select_item(): Displays the selected menu item on the LCD

How It Works

The LCD displays a menu of items.

Up and Down buttons move the cursor through the menu.

The menu scrolls automatically if the selected item moves beyond the visible rows.

Pressing Select displays the selected menu item for 1 second.

The menu then returns to normal operation.
