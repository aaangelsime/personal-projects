Big Picture:
    Building a tiny networking stack, in userspace, instead of relying on Linux's built-in networking code.

    TCP/IP Stack:
        The full set of software layers that turn raw data into network communication and back again
            ~ Is a layered software that moves data from applications to the network and back using TCP, IP, & Ethernet rules.
            ~ The code that lets our computer say "send this message to that computer" and makes it happen
        
        Stack = Layers
            Layers:             Roles:                      Analogy:
            Application         What you want to say        Writing the letter
            TCP                 Reliable delivery           Tracking & guarantees
            IP                  Where to send               Address on box
            Ethernet            How it physically travels   Delivery truck

            note(s): Each layer:
                - Adds its own header
                - Passes data downward
                - Receives data upward
    TAP Device:
        ~ A virtual Ethernet card
        ~ Controlled by your program
        ~ Linux thinks it;s a real network interface

    Teaches:
        - How the internet actually works
        - Why bigs happen
        - Why performance tuning is hard 
        - How kernels and drivers interact


Phase 0:
    - Develop a program the creates a fake ethernet card (TAP)
    - Reads raw Ethernet frames
    - Recognize ARP request 
    - Sends ARP replies
    - Linux updates its ARP cache -> success

Phase 1:
    - Create a clean layout

    tcpip/

        |-main.c
        |-tap.c
        |-tap.h
        |-ethernet.h
        |-arp.c 
        |-arp.h
        |-utils.h
        |_Makefile


Question(s):

    Q1) Why can't TCP work without IP?
    A1) Because TCP needs IP to deliver packets to the correct machine

    Q2) Why do Ethernets exists? or how do i send data to another machine on the same local network?
    A1) Ethernet doesn;t care about IP address, Ports, TCP, & the internet. 
            Ethernet only knows MAC Addresses and frames.
            Key Rule: Ethernet can only deliver packets inside one Local Network (LAN)
            Ethernet Needs: Source MAC and Destination MAC addresses

    Q3) Why ARP Exists? 
        The problem: Applications know IP addresses, not MAC addresses
    
    Example: 

    10.0.0.4, but ethernet needs 00:0c:29:6d:50:25. 
    So we ask: "Who owns IP 10.0.0.4?"
    
    That's ARP ~ basiccally yelling on the LAN

    The owner replies: "Me! My MAC is 00:0c:29:6d:50:25"

    Then Linux caches that answer

    Key Takeaways 

    - Ethernet = Local delivery using MAC addresses
    - ARP = IP -> MAC lookup
    - IP = Global Delivery
    - TCP = Reliability
    - TAP device = fake ethernet card

    tap.c / tap.h :
        - This function creates a cirtual network interface (TAP device) on linux and returns
          a file descriptor that allows the program to read and write raw Ethernet packets
          directly to the operating system, just as if it were a physical network card.
