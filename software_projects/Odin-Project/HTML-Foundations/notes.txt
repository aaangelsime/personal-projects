HTML = HyperText Markup Language
     = The raw data that a webpage is built out of.
     = Puts info on a webpage.

Elements and Tags

Elements
    - Used to create all of the paragraphs, headings, lists, images,
    and links that make up a typical webpage.
    ~ "Containers" for content 

    Example:

    <p>some text context</p> = a full paragraph element 

Tags
    - Are the essential building blocks that define the struct and content
    of a webpage
    - <> opening Tags - tell the browser the start of an HTML element
    - </> closing Tags - tell browser where an HTML element ends

HTML BoilerPlate = basic structure in every HTML doc.

    - Every html page starts w/ doctype declaration
    
    Doctype <!Doctype html> = tells browser what version of html it should use to render doc
    
    lang attribute = specifies the language of the text content in 
    that element

    head element <head> = is where we put important info about webpages

    meta element <meta charset = "UTF-8"> = "encoding". is very important
    because it ensures that the webpage will display special symbols and char
    from different languages correctly in the browser. Always in Head

    body element <body> = where all the content will be displayed to users.

Working with text:
    Types of elements for text
        <p> for paragraphs
        <h1-6> for headings
        <strong> for bold text
        <em> for italic text
        <!-- comments --> short cut ctrl + /

Unordered List Example:
    <ul>
        <li>item</li>
    </ul>

Ordered List Example:
    <ol>
        <li>item</li>
    </ol>

Other Note(s):

    - Name HTML files index.html, by default browsers will try to find
    an index.html file.
