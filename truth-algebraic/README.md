Truth Table Generator from Algebraic Expressions (C++)
📖 Project Overview

This project is a C++ program that converts and completes a truth table from a given Boolean algebraic expression. The program takes in a logical expression as input and automatically generates the corresponding truth table, helping users visualize how the output depends on different combinations of inputs.

The idea for this project originated from my Digital Logic course, where I was inspired by the challenge of manually constructing truth tables. This program simplifies that process by handling the conversions programmatically, making it a helpful tool for both learning and practice.

✨ Features

Input a Boolean algebraic expression.

Parse and evaluate the expression step by step.

Generate a complete truth table for all possible input combinations.

Useful for students, educators, or anyone learning digital logic.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: C++

Concepts Applied:

Parsing and evaluating Boolean expressions

Logic gates and truth table construction

Control structures and functions in C++

🎯 Purpose

Reinforce my understanding of digital logic fundamentals.

Apply C++ programming skills to solve a practical problem.

Create a tool that can save time and reduce human error when working with Boolean algebra.

🚀 Future Improvements

Add support for more complex expressions (nested parentheses, XOR, NAND, NOR, etc.).

Provide a step-by-step breakdown of the evaluation for learning purposes.

Expand into a GUI-based application for easier interaction.
